# Rainbow, Corona Simulation

My simulation program for rainbow and corona.

As we know, tiny water drops in the air may produce rainbow and corona.
Descartes first explain the rainbow with geometry optics over three and a half centuries ago.
Then Airy improved the theory by taking difraction into account one and a half centruies ago.
And half a century later, Lorenz, Mie and Debye derived the most accurate model, which is often called Lorenz-Mie theory and Deby series.

My simulation is based on Lorenz-Mie theory. See [Mie scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering) for detail.

## Rainbow

Size of water drops change the appearance of rainbow dramatically.
When drop size is large, it follows the geometry optics limit, and no supernumerary can be seen;
when drop size is small, diffraction and interference are getting significant, and supernumerary is getting visible.
